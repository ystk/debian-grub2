    - If we find a background image and no colours were specified, use
      upstream defaults for color_normal and color_highlight rather than
      setting color_normal to black/black.
    - Don't try the other alternatives when $GRUB_BACKGROUND is set; you can
      now add GRUB_BACKGROUND= to /etc/default/grub to force no background
      image (closes: #608263).

  * Backport from upstream:
    - Support big ext2 files (closes: #543924).
    - Fix gettext quoting to work with bash as /bin/sh, and make echo
      UTF-8-clean so that (at least) Catalan boot messages are displayed
      properly (closes: #605615).
    - Initialise next pointer when creating multiboot module (closes:

    - Fix PCI probing hangs by skipping remaining functions on devices that
      do not implement function 0 (closes: #594967).
  * Use semicolons rather than commas to separate size from model in debconf
    disk and partition descriptions; commas are too easily confused with the
    multiselect choice separator, and in particular make it impossible to
    answer questions properly in the editor frontend (closes: #608449).

  * Update Homepage field (thanks, Sedat Dilek).
  * On Linux, if /boot/grub/device.map exists on upgrade to this version,
    regenerate it to use stable device names in /dev/disk/by-id/.  If it had
    more than one entry, then display a critical-priority debconf note
    (sorry, but it's better than silently breaking boot menu entries)
    advising people to check custom boot menu entries and update them if
    necessary (closes: #583271).
  * Use 'set -e' rather than '#! /bin/sh -e' or '#! /bin/bash -e', to avoid

  * Store grub-pc/install_devices as persistent device names under
    /dev/disk/by-id/ (closes: #554790).  Migrate previous device names to
    that, with explicit confirmation in non-trivial cases to make sure we
    got the right ones.  If the devices we were told to install to ever go
    away, ask again.  (This is based on the implementation in Ubuntu.)
  * If grub-install fails during upgrade-from-grub-legacy, allow the user to
    try again with a different device, but failing that cancel the upgrade
    (closes: #587790).

  * Touch a marker file when grub-install is run but GRUB Legacy files are

  * If GRUB Legacy files are present when upgrading, scan boot sectors of
    all disks for GRUB 2.  If we find GRUB 2 installed anywhere, then ask
    the user if they want to finish conversion to GRUB 2, and warn them that
    not doing so may render the system unbootable (closes: #586143).  Thanks
    to Sedat Dilek for helping to narrow down this bug.
  * Leaving grub-pc/install_devices empty makes sense in some situations,
    but more often than not is a mistake.  On the other hand, automatically
    selecting all disk devices would upset some people too.  Compromise by
    simply asking for explicit confirmation if grub-pc/install_devices is

grub2 (1.98+20100602-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New Bazaar snapshot.
    - Add btrfs probing support, currently only in the single-device case
      (closes: #540786).
    - Fix grub-emu build on mips/powerpc/sparc.
    - Add safety check to make sure that /boot/grub/locale exists before
      trying to probe it (closes: #567211).
    - Several 'info grub' improvements, including a new section on
      configuration file generation using grub-mkconfig which documents the
      available keys in /etc/default/grub (closes: #497085).
    - Many USB fixes.

  [ Colin Watson ]
  * Reorganise configure and build targets in debian/rules to use stamp
    files.  configure/* never existed and build/* was always a directory, so
    make never considered either of them up to date (closes: #450505).
  * Remove config.h.in from AUTOGEN_FILES, since autoheader doesn't
    necessarily update it.
  * Remove conf/gcry.mk from AUTOGEN_FILES, and conf/gcry.rmk from their
    dependencies.  autogen.sh runs util/import_gcry.py after autoconf et al,
    so conf/gcry.rmk's timestamp will be later than some of the
    autogenerated outputs.
  * Go back to shipping rescue images in the grub-rescue-pc .deb itself
    rather than generating them in the postinst.  This means that (a) they
    get removed when the package is removed (closes: #584176); (b) they are
    listed in package metadata, as is proper for files in /usr (closes:
    #584218); (c) grub-rescue-pc can potentially be used as a
    build-dependency for other packages that need to build GRUB images into
    installation media etc., without having to build-depend on grub-pc which
    isn't coinstallable with other platform variants and does invasive
    things in its postinst.
  * Add grub-mkrescue patch from Thomas Schmitt to allow reducing the size
    of xorriso-created images.  Use this to ensure that
    grub-rescue-floppy.img fits well within size limits (closes: #548320).

  * Don't leak debconf's file descriptor to update-grub, so that the LVM

    any case os-prober 1.36 suppresses the warnings.
