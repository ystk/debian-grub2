Template: grub2/device_map_regenerated
Type: note
_Description: /boot/grub/device.map has been regenerated
 The file /boot/grub/device.map has been rewritten to use stable device
 names. In most cases, this should significantly reduce the need to change
 it in future, and boot menu entries generated by GRUB should not be
 affected.
 .
 However, since more than one disk is present in the system, it is possible
 that the system is depending on the old device map. Please check whether
 there are any custom boot menu entries that rely on GRUB's (hdN) drive
 numbering, and update them if necessary.
 .
 If you do not understand this message, or if there are no custom
 boot menu entries, you can ignore this message.
